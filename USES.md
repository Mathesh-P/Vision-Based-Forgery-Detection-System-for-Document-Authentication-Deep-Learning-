*Table: Representative taxonomy of categories of applications for crowdsourced microprediction.*

Within each of these categories, there can be further subdivisions. For example, under "Recognition," subcategories might include handwriting, remote sensing, radiology, EEG signals, text, etc. 
Similarly, "Facial" recognition can be broken down into age recognition, emotion detection, and more. This combinatorial explosion highlights the vast potential scope of microprediction tasks across various domains.
