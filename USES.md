# Uses of prediction fan-out illustration

We start with things that have already been the subject of data science contest, then illustrate the fan-out. 

## Categories of Use in Data Science Contests

Below is a table illustrating the variety of application categories where data science contests have been employed. Each major category is further divided into sub-categories and sub-sub-categories to demonstrate the breadth of use cases.

*Table: Representative taxonomy of categories of applications for crowdsourced microprediction.*

Within each of these categories, there can be further subdivisions. For example, under "Recognition," subcategories might include handwriting, remote sensing, radiology, EEG signals, text, etc. 
Similarly, "Facial" recognition can be broken down into age recognition, emotion detection, and more. This combinatorial explosion highlights the vast potential scope of microprediction tasks across various domains.
